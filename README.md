## Prerequisites

Install `gemini` and/or `qwen-code` CLIs to your system PATH for plugin functionality. 

*   [gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) 
*   [qwen-code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)

## Installation

You can install the plugin using `lazy.nvim`:

```lua
{
  "gutsavgupta/nvim-gemini-companion",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "folke/snacks.nvim",
  },
  event = "VeryLazy",
  config = function()
    -- You can configure the plugin by passing a table to the setup function
    -- Example:
    -- require("gemini").setup({
    --   cmds = {"gemini"},
    --   win = {
    --     preset = "floating",
    --     width = 0.8,
    --     height = 0.8,
    --   }
    -- })
    require("gemini").setup()
  end,
  keys = {
    { "<leader>gg", "<cmd>GeminiToggle<cr>", desc = "Toggle Gemini CLI"},
    { "<leader>gc", "<cmd>GeminiClose<cr>", desc = "Close Gemini CLI process"},
    { "<leader>ga", "<cmd>GeminiAccept<cr>", desc = "Accept Gemini suggested changes"},
    { "<leader>gr", "<cmd>GeminiReject<cr>", desc = "Reject Gemini suggested changes"},
    { "<leader>gD", "<cmd>GeminiSendFileDiagnostic<cr>", desc = "Send File Diagnostics"},
    { "<leader>gd", "<cmd>GeminiSendLineDiagnostic<cr>", desc = "Send Line Diagnostics"},
    { "<leader>gs", "<cmd>GeminiSwitchSidebarStyle<cr>", desc = "Switch Sidebar Style"},
  }
}
```

## Configuration

The following options are available in the `setup` function:

*   `cmds`: A list of commands to run for the CLI agents. Defaults to `{ "gemini", "qwen" }`.
    *   The plugin checks if the agent is installed in the system PATH and only enables it if found.
    *   If you want to use only one agent, you can set it as a single command string, e.g., `cmd = "gemini"`.
*   `win`: This option configures the window for the Gemini sidebar. It respects the `snacks.win` options from the [`folke/snacks.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim) library. For more information on the available options, please refer to the [snacks.win documentation](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/win.md).

### Sidebar Presets

The plugin comes with a few preset styles for the sidebar. You can set a preset using the `preset` key within the `win` option. The available presets are:
*   `right-fixed` (default)
*   `left-fixed`
*   `bottom-fixed`
*   `floating`

You can also override any of the preset's options by specifying them in the `win` table. For example, to use the `floating` preset but with a custom width and height:
```lua
require("gemini").setup({
  win = {
    preset = "floating",
    width = 0.8,
    height = 0.8,
  }
})
```

You can also switch between presets on the fly to find the one that best suits your needs using the `GeminiSwitchSidebarStyle` command.

## For Developers: Running Tests

To run the tests, you'll need to have `plenary.nvim` and `snacks.nvim` available. The test setup assumes a standard `lazy.nvim` directory structure.

Execute the following command from the root of the repository

```bash
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$(pwd)/tests nvim --headless -c "PlenaryBustedDirectory tests"
```
This command will run all tests in the `tests` directory. To test a single file try: `-c "PlenaryBustedFile tests/ideMcpServer_spec.lua"`

### Important Notes

*   The test environment requires `plenary.nvim` and `snacks.nvim`. The test configuration file (`tests/nvim/init.lua`) assumes that these plugins are located at `~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/plenary.nvim` and `~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/snacks.nvim`. If your setup is different, you may need to adjust this path in the `init.lua` file.

## Roadmap

*   **ACP Protocol:** Implement ACP protocol support for deeper integration.
