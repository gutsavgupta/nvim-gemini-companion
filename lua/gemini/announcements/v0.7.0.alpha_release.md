# ðŸŽ‰ v0.7.0.alpha: TMUX Integration & Health Checks!

This release brings powerful new features to bridge the gap between your terminal and Neovim, making your AI workflow smoother than ever!

## âœ¨ New Feature: Tmux Integration

You can now connect the `gemini` and `qwen` CLIs directly to your running Neovim instance from any **Tmux** pane! This enables the CLIs to open files, apply diffs, and interact with your editor seamlessly.

### How to Get Started:

1.  Run `:GeminiMuxInstallWrappers` to set up the integration.
2.  Ensure the installation directory (`~/.local/bin` by default) is in your `$PATH`.
3.  That's it! Now, when you use `gemini` or `qwen` in a Tmux session, they will connect to Neovim.

## ðŸ©º New Feature: Health Check

To help you diagnose your setup, we've added a new health check panel. Just run:

```
:checkhealth gemini
```

This will verify your binary locations, IDE server status, and the new Tmux integration setup.
