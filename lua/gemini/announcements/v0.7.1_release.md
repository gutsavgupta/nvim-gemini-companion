# v0.7.1 Release Announcement

## üéâ Improvements

### Enhanced Sidebar Terminal Switching
The sidebar terminal switching functionality has been improved with more reliable behavior:
- Only switches between *active* terminals (no more spawning new processes when switching)
- Supports forward and backward navigation between active terminals
- Better safety checks to prevent errors when few terminals are active

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

### Behavior Change
- **Old**: `<Tab>` would hide current terminal and spawn/show the next one in the list
- **New**: `<M-]>` (Alt+]) and `<M-[>` (Alt+[) only switch between already *active* terminals without spawning new processes

### Function Renamed
- **Old**: `require('gemini.ideSidebar').switchTerms()`
- **New**: `require('gemini.ideSidebar').switchSidebar()`

## üîÑ What You Need to Do

### If You're Using the Function Manually
If you were calling `switchTerms()` manually in your configuration, update your code:

```lua
-- Change from this:
require('gemini.ideSidebar').switchTerms()

-- To this:
require('gemini.ideSidebar').switchSidebar([direction])
-- where direction can be 'next' (default) or 'prev'
```

### For Key Binding Customization
If you want to customize the terminal switching key bindings, see the updated README documentation which shows how to override the default Alt-based mappings.
