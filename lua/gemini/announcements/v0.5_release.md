# nvim-gemini-companion v0.5 Release 🚀

## 🌟 Features

1. **Dependency-Free** ⚡: We've removed the `folke/snacks.nvim` dependency! The plugin is now standalone. 
   - **Configuration to remove**: `{'folke/snacks.nvim'}` (strike through this from your plugin manager config)
   
2. **Multi-Agent Support** 🤖: Now you can spawn multiple instances of agents simultaneously! 
   - Run different AI agents (Gemini & Qwen) at the same time & Switch between agents using `<Tab>` in terminal mode
   - Example configuration: `cmds = {'gemini', 'gemini', 'qwen'}` for 2 Gemini and 1 Qwen agents in your sidebar
   - Each agent runs independently with its own terminal instance

3. **Vim Commands for Diffs** ✨: Use `:wq` and `:q` in diff views to accept/reject changes (inspired by vim.pack).

## 🔧 Important Fixes

1. **No More Stale Buffers** 🧹: Fixed the issue with '[No Name]' buffers appearing after every diff operation.
2. **Proper Server Cleanup** 🛡️: Fixed server not closing properly on VimLeave events (resulting in an error pop-up)
