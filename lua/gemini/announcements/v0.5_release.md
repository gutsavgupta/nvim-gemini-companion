nvim-gemini-companion v0.5 Release 🚀

🌟 Features

1. **Dependency-Free** ⚡: We've removed the bulky `folke/snacks.nvim` dependency! Requesting user to remove `{'folke/snacks.nvim'}` from your plugin config

2. **Multi-Agent Support** 🤖: Now you can spawn multiple instances of agents simultaneously! Example configuration: `cmds = {'gemini', 'gemini', 'qwen'}` for 2 Gemini and 1 Qwen agents in your sidebar

3. **Vim Commands for Diffs** ✨: Use `:wq` and `:q` in diff views to accept/reject changes (inspired by vim.pack).

🔧 Important Fixes

1. **No More Stale Buffers** 🧹: Fixed the issue with stale '[No Name]' buffers increasing after every diff operation.

2. **Proper Server Cleanup** 🛡️: Fixed server not closing properly on VimLeave events (resulting in an error pop-up)
